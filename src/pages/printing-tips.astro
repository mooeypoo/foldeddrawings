				Because your drawings should come out just as clean and crisp as they look on screen.

			</p>

			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">For best results:</h2>
			<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-8">
				<li>Print at <span class="font-semibold">100% scale</span> (turn off “fit to page”)</li>
				<li>Use plain paper or slightly thicker stock (120–160gsm / 32–43lb)</li>
				<li>Black-and-white or grayscale mode works perfectly</li>
				<li>If lines look faint, turn off “photo smoothing,” “eco mode,” or extra ink-saving features</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">
				These drawings are purposely simple so they stay crisp, high-contrast, and easy to color. If you ever run into printing issues, you can always reach out through Etsy messages or the contact form here.
			</p>

			<p class="text-gray-800 font-semibold text-center">
				Happy printing!
